            <h2>News & Important Updates</h2>

            <div class="news-item">
                <h3>MIMIC is Officially on IMDb!</h3>
                <p>Congratulations, everyone! MIMIC now has its own official page on IMDb, recognizing our hard work and the film's standing.</p>
                <p>View the MIMIC IMDb page here: <a href="https://pro.imdb.com/title/tt28823774/" target="_blank">IMDb.com/title/tt28823774</a> (<em>Note: Replace this with your actual IMDb page URL!</em>)</p>
                <h4>Claiming Your IMDb Pro Credit:</h4>
                <p>To "claim" your credit and ensure your name appears prominently with a profile picture, you'll need an IMDb Pro Membership. You can sign up here: <a href="https://m.imdb.com/membership" target="_blank">IMDb Pro Membership</a></p>
                <p>Once you've completed your membership and set up your profile, please notify us so we can ensure your specific profile is correctly linked to the MIMIC page.</p>
                <p><strong>Important Note on Suffixes and Prefixes (e.g., MD):</strong></p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Where a name includes a suffix (IlI, Jr.), we do not use a comma to separate it from the name, regardless of how it appears on screen. It is treated as an integral part of the surname, i.e. Downey Jr., Robert. The same applies to the corresponding suffixes in foreign languages, like père, fils, hijo, etc. Courtesy titles like Mr., Dr., Sir, and degree indications like Ph.D., are not considered part of the name, and are not included in the primary name, even if that is how the name appears on screen. They are included as alternate names. (Exception: In the silent era, it was not unusual for women to be credited as, i.e., Mrs. John Smith -- in such cases, Mrs. is an integral part of the name, since John Smith is an entirely different person)" - IMDb.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>For individuals like Hari, while IMDb does not allow suffixes (e.g., MD) attached directly to the primary name on the poster/IMDb page, your name is listed as requested in the film's credits. Having a personal IMDb Pro profile with your picture will help distinguish your name from similar ones.</p>
